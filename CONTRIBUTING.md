## Tech Skills Assessment

Please take a few minutes to fill out our brief [Tech Skills Assessment](http://goo.gl/forms/1rwP1lOjbU). This will provide our tech leads with a sense of your proficiencies and availability so that they might allocate your skills and time most efficiently.

## Git Flow

We recommend using [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as a development workflow for incorporating new features and fixes and issuing releases.

## Code Quality

* Do your best to provide test coverage for all of your code. As developers, we understand that challenging timelines and circumstances often force us to forego best practices such as testing.

* We also recommend implementing and following a coding style guide to ensure consistency and increase the readability of your work throughout your project. Some helpful tools include:
  
  * [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  * [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
  * [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
  * [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint)
